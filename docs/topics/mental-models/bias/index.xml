This tendence is stronger in case of ideologically or emotionally charged arguments.
When we want a certain idea to be true, and we end up thinking and acting as if it was true, that is confirmation bias in action. Our eyes and brains filter out any information that would disprove what we have already decided to be true beyond doubt.</description></item></channel></rss>
