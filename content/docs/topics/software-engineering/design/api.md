# API design

NENO (non-exhaustive, non-ordered) list of questions to keep in mind and ask yourself when designing an API, or any software for that matter.

* Imagine a developer with zero knowledge of your API starts using it. How long will they take to be proficient with it?
* How much new knowledge do they need to acquire? How much prior knowledge can they reuse?
* If I imagine myself using this API tomorrow, would that be a pleasurable experience?
* Can someone understand what each function/endpoint does just by looking at the signature?
* Do the default values make sense?
* Is the naming and the order/type of the parameters consistent?
* Is it well documented? Can I get all the information I need without having to look at the code?
* Are things obvious? And if they're not, is there a good reason for that?
* Does using the API require to write a lot of duplicated code? Can that be avoided?
* Is it easy for the users to do the right thing? Is it hard to do the wrong thing?
